Allen Viljoen publicly posted projects.

The purpose of this repo is to store all projects I work on that I don't otherwise wish to remain private.

The main contents of this repo are intended to be source code, scripts, CAD files, other application files, configuration files, and documentation for any personal projects I work on.

Personal projects will include coding projects, electrical engineering projects, CAD projects, and any other files created pursuant to any self-study I do while trying to learn any marketable engineering-related skill.
